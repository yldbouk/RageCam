# RageCam

When playing a fighting game, it's nice to know your enemy is raging. You can almost imagine their scrunched up face, all red from immense displesure. But what happens when you are the one who's raging? 

- It's all fun and games till you're the one raging.
  
RageCam takes a picture of you after the end of a round and saves it to your computer.

## Supported Games
For now, only `GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-` is supported. As program development progresses, more games will be added.
